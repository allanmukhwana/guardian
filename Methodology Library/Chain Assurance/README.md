## What it does

Chain Assurance is a web-based application designed to assist businesses in managing and enhancing their suppliers' Climate Preparedness and ESG practices. Our platform provides functionalities such as automated supplier assessments, customized questionnaire creation, ESG score benchmarks, and action plans for operation improvements.

### Policy Description

Our policy focuses on bridging the gaps between businesses and their suppliers, ensuring that both parties are committed to upholding mutually agreed climate goals and ESG standards. By systematically recording, analyzing, and sharing suppliers' sustainability performances, businesses can drive a standardized approach towards improved sustainability.

### Workflow Description

Here is a detailed breakdown of our automated workflow within each menu item:

1. **Dashboard:** Chain Assurance's workflow begins with the Dashboard, providing an at-a-glance overview of key operational metrics such as active surveys, average ESG scores, and recent supplier updates. All metrics are dynamically updated in real-time to provide a snapshot of current operations.

2. **Supplier Management:** Users can leverage automation technologies to manage their supplier base effectively. With the click of a button, new suppliers can be added, existing ones edited, and their ESG performances tracked over time. As a digital hub, this area ensures all relevant supplier data is accessible and easy to manage.

3. **Survey Management:** Our platform eases the survey process using automation. With intuitive forms, users create tailored surveys for each supplier. Once approved, these are automatically sent out to respective suppliers. The responses are collected, validated, and stored, minimizing manual input and reducing the chance of errors.

4. **Scoring & Benchmarking:** After responses are collected, the system automatically calculates ESG scores using a set formula embedded within the smart contract. These scores are then used to generate performance reports and can be benchmarked against industry standards, providing a comparative view of a supplier's commitment to ESG practices.

5. **Reports & Analytics:** Chain Assurance promotes data-driven decisions, with automated reports on ESG performance readily available. Our machine learning algorithms analyze these scores to produce predictive analytics reports, offering valuable insights into likely future trends and outcomes.

6. **Administration:** Management of platform settings, user roles and permissions are enabled through automation, making the administration process more streamlined and less time-consuming.

7. **Help Center:** To assist users, our Help Center offers resources and guides on using different features of the application, providing 24/7 support through automated FAQs and troubleshooting tips. 

In summary, our workflow exercises automation in every possible aspect, from survey distribution to report generation, ensuring an efficient operational management approach for users and promoting sustainable supply chain practices.

### Comparative Analysis to Similar Methodologies

There are a number of other supplier assessment tools available but the key differentiating factor of Chain Assurance is its integration with Hedera Guardian for added transparency and the ongoing use of machine learning tools to provide predictive analytics. 

## How we built it

Chain Assurance is built on Hedera Hashgraph technology. We utilized the Hedera Consensus Service for our audit log and the Hedera Smart Contract Service for establishing digital agreements with suppliers. For scoring calculations and predictive analytics, we have integrated machine learning algorithms.

## Challenges we ran into

We faced challenges in setting up Hedera smart contracts as it was a new technology for us. Additionally building an intuitive and user-friendly interface that handles complex data algorithms in a digestible way was another challenge.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

We've created a platform that doesn't just encourage but enforces transparency and climate accountability in supply chains. Our machine-learning driven predictive analytics feature is a highlight and testament to our commitment of innovation.
 
## What we learned

We learned about Hedera's application in real-world use-cases, gained practical experience in smart contract development, and deepened our understanding of the impact blockchain can have on climate health.

## What's next for Chain Assurance

We aim to improve our predictive analysis features and streamline our survey distribution process. Furthermore, we plan to expand beyond the B2B market to allow chain stores and end consumers to track the carbon footprint of their purchases, driving widespread climate accountability.
